Title: An Image Analysis Approach to the Early Detection of Pressure Ulcers

Proposer: Bello, Fernando

Description: Pressure ulcers represent a costly problem affecting a significant proportion of the population, with the vast majority of those affected being elderly patients admitted into care. The cost to heal each ulcer ranges from a few hundred pounds to several thousand, with a considerable overall estimated cost to the healthcare system. Pressure ulcers are not only costly, but are also associated with increased mortality. They occur when unrelieved pressure, typically over a bony protrusion, initially causes blood to pool at the site. Blood vessels are constricted and the skin is starved of oxygen and other nutrients. If not diagnosed and relieved of pressure early, the skin or even underlying tissue and bone may ulcerate. Early detection is thus key to avoiding pressure ulcers and the subsequent treatment costs, with several non-invasive techniques, including image processing and analysis, recently being developed for this purpose.

The aim of this project is to explore the feasibility of using non-invasive techniques for the early detection of pressure ulcers. Emphasis will be placed on exploring a range of image processing and image analysis techniques using a standard software package.

The student will commence by familiarising her/himself with pressure ulcers, conducting a review of the different invasive and non-invasive techniques commonly used for their early detection. At the same time, s/he will learn how to use the Matlab software and its image processing toolbox. Working under the guidance of the clinical lead (Prof Norton), s/he will then experiment with a range of image processing techniques as published in the literature, using samples from a photographic database of real pressure ulcers, aiming to build a processing pipeline, which will then be systematically evaluated using a new series of photographs with and without pressure ulcers. Issues around the deployment and usability of the resulting image processing pipeline will be explored with collaborating clinicians, software engineers, design engineers and human factors experts.

Programming/development will be done using C++ using Visual Studio.

The project will be based at St Mary's and Chelsea & Westminster Hospitals. There will be support and interaction from the clinical lead (Prof Christine Norton).
