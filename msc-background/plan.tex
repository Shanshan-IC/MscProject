\chapter{Progress} 

I have already broken the project down into three main parts: modelling, implementation and evaluation. Modelling will focus on image process algorithms. In the implementation phase, the model is transformed in computer code and implemented into the software. During modelling and implementation are sufficiently far along that the code is producing
results, then the evaluation stage can begin and results can be
analysed. Although separate they are not independent. For example, difficulties in implementation may require a rethink in the
model, the implementation must include code that stores results for
evaluation and evaluation of results may lead to changes in the model. Most of the progress so far has been on modelling and so I shall focus
on it for this chapter.
