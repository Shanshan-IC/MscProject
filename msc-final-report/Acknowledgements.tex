I would like to express my appreciation to all those who provided me the possibility to complete this report. A special gratitude I give to Dr. Bello Fernando for supervising this project. His helpful guides got me to start with an agent-based modelling software and finish this report.

This project is the culmination of my MSc Computing Science year at Imperial College London. I could not have achieved so much without the excellent teaching and facilities available here in Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Colleagues in the office have also been great sources of wisdom as I learn the necessary pressure ulcers knowledge and computer programming. I am also hugely indebted to everyone who has contributed to the software that I have used during this project.

Finally I'd like to thank my family and friends for all their support.
