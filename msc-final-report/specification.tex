\chapter{Specification} \label{chapter:model}
The specification consisted of high-level essential requirements. This section discusses their completion status. Detailed table expatiating specifications are given in table 3.1 by applying the simplified version of van Lamsweerde\textquotesingle s KAOS goal-oriented model \cite{kaos}, questioning how and why a particular requirement is applied.

\end{itemize}

\section{Image Process}
Category: high risk, high priority. Status: complete(extended).
\begin{itemize}
\item{Original Steps:}\\

\end{itemize}
When an image is acquired by a camera or other image system, often the vision system for which it is intended is unable to use it directly. The image may be corrupted by random variations in tensity, variations in illumination, or poor contrast that must be dealt with in the early stages of vision process, which is the reason why using image filter to enhance it.

\section{Area Detection}
Category: high risk, high priority. Status: complete.
\begin{itemize}
\item{Original Steps:}\\
Detect the disease area automatically - complete.
\end{itemize}

\section{Eulerian Color Magnification:}
Category: high risk, high priority. Status: complete.
\begin{itemize}
\item{Original Steps:}\\
Detect the disease area automatically - complete.
\end{itemize}
Using Eulerian Video Magnification to reveal temporal variations in videos that are difficult or impossible to see with the naked eye and display them in an indicative manner.
